Colonel Jaffe, retired.
I' m also the coach here at the academy.
Ah.
What do you prefer?
"Coach" or "Colonel"?
I prefer "God."
But that would be unseemly.
I' d show you around the academy myself, son, but I' m a little busy right now.
So I' m gonna have my daughter Winter give you the grand tour.
Winter!
Report to admissions office, double time, soldier!
- Do you copy?
- I' m coming, Daddy!
I' m coming!
Copy that!
(grunting)
(both sigh)
Thank you.
Go, go.
That' s real attractive, Brandt.
(moans)
I' m her daddy.
Yes, Daddy?
Winter, I want you to meet Billy Wagstaff, a new member of the academy.
- Billy, meet Winter.
- That' s an interesting name, Winter.
So is..
Billy.
I named her Winter because she' s as pure as the driven snow.
I hear different and someone dies.
Now, I want you to show Wagstaff here everything the academy has to offer, little girl.
And save that halfpipe till last.
All right?
We got the best halfpipe in the country, son.
- Yeah?
What happened to the other half?
- Very humorous.
I want you back here at 0600 for orientation.
Maybe you can see how funny myworld is.
- Man.
- Let' s go, Mr. Wagstaff.
Hey, Winter.
Why don' t you let me show the new guy around?
I' m sure you' ve got better things to do.
Thought I did, but they weren' t any better.
I' d be more than happy to show the new member around myself.
Come on.
(Billy) Whoo!
Yeah, Winter!
Looking good!
Wait till you see the gorge.
It' s tight and wet, but it sure feels good when you go down it.
- Race you to the bottom.
- You got it.
- Well?
- It' s great.
Everything is great.
Can we ride it?
And can you go first?
You know, just give me the lay of the land.
Who told you my nickname?
- Oh- ho.
- Follow me if you can keep up.
Keeping up is no problem.
God, I love her.
(¢Ü "High" by Hydrophonix)
This is a little move I like to call "Keep the change."
Make sure the steam is blowing up against the boobies so the na- nas stand up.
Then make sure you get some foam on the ta- tas.
And then dip with your finger like this.
And then put your finger all the way in your mouth to lick it off.
There you go.
That' il be four dollars.
(shuffling bills)
Keep the change.
That was so.. cool.
Yep.
These tits are practically paying for themselves.
I don' t think I have the na- nas, the ta- tas, the boo- boos or the ba- bas for that.
You' re right.
Those aren' t exactly moneymakers.
But I think we can work with that little ass of yours.
- Get me a muffin.
- OK.
Oh, yeah, that works.
Looks like I got a new muffin girl.
- So, what dorm are you staying in?
- Oh, I can' t afford to.
My friend and I are getting a place in town.
In town?
You' re gonna live with the poories?
Poories?
That' s what we call the locals in Schittville.
Poories - 'cause they' re poor.
Get it?
Poor.. ies.
Yeah, um..
I guess that makes me a poorie.
What do you guys call yourselves?
The richies, 'cause you' re rich.. ies?
As a matter of fact, we do.
Oh.
Clever.
Yeah.
I hope you were clever enough to wear a lot of warm clothes.
- Why?
- Because I don' t hang out with poories.
See you in another life - hopefully a richer one.
Bye- bye.
Aaaarghhh!
God, I' m in love.
Casey Richards, welcome to paradise!
- Oh.
- Huh?
I think you made the right choice coming to Blind Danny Temples for all your realty needs.
Now, just so you know, the trick to being blind is to memorize your surroundings.
That' s the key.
- (screams) - (Casey) Oh, God!
Oh, my God!
Don' t help me, don' t help me.
I' m not a cripple, I' m not a cripple.
Cane, cane, cane, cane, cane!
- Here.
- Thank you.
You' re welcome.
- So, what do you think?
- Uh..
As you can see, this is our deluxe single.
And.. this is all fresh paint.
Just had this done.
If you step right this way, you will see.. the most beautiful mountain view in all Pine Valley!
- Beautiful!
- (sniffs) Take a smell!
- Ah!
That mountain air!
- (coughs)
And that' s Schittville.
So, what do you think?
- You wanna rent the place?
- Sure.
All right.
Enjoy.
Thanks.
- Let me help you to the door.
- I don' t need help, I don' t need help.
I' ve got this place memorized to a T.
Whoo!
(laughs)
Can' t believe those idiots rented this shithole.
- Here, Danny, want me to show you out?
- Oh, Jesus!
- (nervous chuckle) I was kiddin 'around.
- Yeah?
- It was a joke!
- Yeah?
- It' s not bad.
- Tell that to him.
Yeah, it' s not too bad for a couple of poories.
- Poories?
What' s that?
- It' s what they call us at the academy.
- Why?
Because we' re poor?
- Well, actually, yeah.
OK, so what do they do?
They call themselves the richies?
No.
Yes.
- Hey, is this the..?
- No talking in the lecture hall.
Well, how are we gonna get a lecture if there' s no talking in the lecture hall?
(German accent) No wisecracking in the lecture hall either, mystery party crasher.
(Nordic accent) Keep the talking, and my ass you can be eating, 'cause I' m making the bad report on you, new blabby guy.
OK..
(sighs) Fun group.
Ten- hut!
As you were, gentlemen.
Introduce yourselves to the new recruit, William Wagstaff.
Hey, brahs.
We don' t refer to people as "bra," Wagstaff.
You see, a bra is something that holds up a woman' s titties.
Is that what you are?
Something that holds up a woman' s titties?
On a good day, yeah.
(Billy chuckles)
- What do you think this is?
Jay Leno?
- (roars of laugher)
This is the best of the best.
What I' m saying is.. snowboarding is the relentless pursuit of perfection, which, of course, is the American way.
Now let me introduce you to the members of the Pine Mountain Academy all- American snowboarding team!
From Germany,
Hans Gruber!
From Sweden, Sven Darden!
From Russia, Nootnik Kratzin!
From Switzerland, via Israel, Schlomo Boardstein!
And you will buddy up with my team captain,
America' s own Brandt Von Hoffman!
For your professional needs, talk to me.
For your personal needs, talk to my daughter, Winter.
(knowing laughter)
All right!
Everyone up on that hill!
Let' s see what you got!
What the fuck are you doing on skis, you homo, Schlomo?
Don' t you know this is a snowboard academy?
Total bagel job, Schlomo!
Zero!
Hey, have a good run, Nootnik.
Your dick is so small, I would not even suck it.
Yeah, it takes a while to learn the language, but I get what you mean!
Thank you.
You snowboard as good as you talk, Nootnik!
And your mother' s a whore!
- Hey, good luck, Sven.
- Ja?
And you have nice cumshots on your face, you bitch jerk- off.
Sven is in the house.
Yeah, you guys are a great bunch of kidders!
Hey, Hans.
Hi, Billy!
Welcome to the academy!
I hope this experience will be good fun for you.
I got a chili bean stuck in my starfish.
You might wanna suck it out, you Nazi fuck!
What?
Oh..
Oh, God.
He was being nice.
Thank you, Hans!
I' d rather fuck a dog - your dog - than watch you do this again.
All right, Brandt!
Show Billy boy here what it takes to be a national champion!
Hey, Brandt.
You know, Wagstiff, you got no shot with Winter Jaffe.
You might fuck her, but that' s as far as it' s gonna go.
Actually, Brandt, that would be plenty for me.
I' m gonna do everything I can to get you kicked out of this academy, Wagstiff.
Just in case you thought you knew how to snowboard, watch this.
Way to go, Brandt!
Beautiful!
Nice move, Brandt!
All right!
OK, Billy!
Show these goofballs why I let you into school!
What was that, Wagstaff?
Huh?
All that wigglin 'around up there.
You look like you got a combination of Tourette' s and the runs.
(phony laughter)
Ha ha ha!
Maybe I should dig up Katharine Hepburn, throw her in there.
She' d give me a smoother run.
- I' ve always been a big fan of her work.
- Oh!
He' s got the balls to sass me!
I think I know how to get the punk out of you.
How about a nice long ride all the way down the mountain, huh?
And if you fall, you start over.
Yes, sir.
No, no.
Where are you going, Wagstaff?
The lift is for snowboarders.
Ass wiggling go- go dancers walk.
Seriously?
Well, how did I miss that?
Have a nice walk, Britney.
(PA) Attention all Pine Mountain Academy members!
Please report to the annual calendar shoot.
Except you, Wagstaff.
I am going to die!
(Naomi) Do it outside.
How was your first day?
Pain.. and terror.
The school' s having a party tonight.
You wanna go?
- Cool.
- Great.
I' m gonna go home, lay down for a while.
Coach made me walk the mountain today.
You must' ve wiggled your ass like a go- go girl.
Can' t you read the fuckin 'sign?
Tell you what, sloppy.
I' il give you an acupuncture treatment.
- For real?
- Fuckin 'A.
My parents are Benihana chefs - long story, don' t ask.
- Look, you want my help or not?
- Does it hurt?
- Have you ever had blood drawn?
- Yeah.
That wasn' t so bad.
Just like that - only 600 times in 20 minutes.
Oh, don' t be such a pussy!
(¢Ü "Also Sprach Zarathustra" by Richard Strauss)
I see the problem.
Your lower back is in spasm.
I' m gonna have to stick some needles in your ass now, sweetie.
Um..
But my butt feels fine.
I' il say!
Why does my butt feel like it needs to cough?
I, uh..
I heat the needles.
(coughs)
Will you just let the person that knows what the fuck they' re doing just do it?
- Hyah!
- OK, yeah.
That hurt.
You know what they say - no pain, no gain.
- Agh!
- No!
- Hyah!
- No!
- Cha!
- No!
- Vom!
- Oh!
- (shriek) - Die, Daddy.
(whimper)
- Just 74 more to go, sweetie.
- Oh, God.
Here.
Bite this.
- It' s all good.
- Really?
I love healing.
Oh!
Ooh!
- Yeah!
- Agh!
Your back feels better now, doesn' t it?
Yeah, back feels good.
My ass feels like it' s been clawed by a litter of panthers.
Your butt looks like that guy from Hellraiser.
He' s gonna be as good as new in about an hour.
My work here is done.
Now I' m gonna get myself all prettied up for the party tonight.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What about the needles?
Hm.
Casey?
Yank 'em out in about half an hour.
Don' t be gentle.
- Is that part of the therapy?
- No.
It' s just more fun that way.
Toodles!
Wow.
That is the sweetest, sexiest, most brutal woman I' ve ever met.
- I think she kinda digs me.
- Really?
Aargh!
You know, back in the day, there wasn' t no richies or poories.
There was just whities.. and then there was others.
And guess who got to ski the goddamn mountain.
It wasn' t like they said black folk could only ride the slushy hill, but, hell, we knewwhat "others" meant.
It wasn' t like we didn' t have our own rules on the slushy hill.
I was a poor motherfucker back then, and I could only afford one ski.
So I rode that slushy hill on one.
- You invented snowboarding?
- I called it "boogie- woogie one- ski."
Then I realized there was only one way to free up the mountain so all men could use it, and that was to do the one thing that no man had ever done before: ski the Goat.
I boogie- woogie one- skied that Goat, and for years after, all men - and bitches too - could ski Pine Mountain.
Oh, it was beautiful, babies.
But, like everything beautiful, people fucked it all up.
I tried to stop 'em, but..
I was pretty fucked up my damn self.
Well, that' s when the Colonel.. the motherfucker stole my one- ski idea and had the mountain declared a private skiing academy.
Then we was all back on the slushy hill.
Brah, why don' t you go do all that shit again and get our mountain back for us?
(all) Yeah!
How am I supposed to do that, Balls?
Pretend I' m not tired, bitter and drunk?
(whistle)
Check it out.
It' s the guys from the cafe.
- Yeah.
Let' s just go this way.
- No, no.
Be polite.
Hey!
Let me buy you brahs a couple of glasses of suds.
Actually, you know, I' m not a bra, mister.
I' m a man.
Bras are what are used to hold up women' s breasts.
Look, we' re only being nice to you
'cause we like the new muffin girl with the dope ass.
(laughs)
And now we' re not gonna buy you any suds.
- Academy members only.
- William Wagstaff.
I should be somewhere on the list.
Oh, yeah.
You' re the new half- poorie kid.
- And you are..?
- Casey Richards.
She' s not in the academy.
She' s my guest.
Sorry.
Only members of the academy can be guests.
Thanks!
Billy, I' m gonna go hang out with the less classy group over there.
Yeah, yeah.
Shot?
- Bubbles..
- Yeah.
Hey, Winter.
Um, yeah.
Fuck off, sweetie.
- Hi!
- Hey.
Hi, Billy.
Come on.
Don' t tell me you' re upset 'cause you' re not over there with your buddy.
Let me tell you something about losin 'a man.
There ain' t one alive worth sheddin 'a tear over.
- Drink up, sister.
- So you' ve never been in love?
Maybe if I could find the guy that could see past my incredible good looks, perfect figure and the sexiest mouth God ever created.
But I don' t know if I could find a guy like that in Schittville.
Maybe he' s sitting right next to you.
Somebody better get Danny away from that beaver before he fucks it - again.
So you didn' t tell me you even had a poorie girlfriend.
(singsong) Somebody might need a blood test.
Casey?
She' s not my girlfriend.
I' ve known her since I was, like, six.
She' s kind of like my sister.
I don' t know.
She' s very pretty.
She is?
Look at him, sittin 'over there like he owns the damn place.
I hate that asshole.
He can suck my..
Black cock!
And he knows it too.
Straight, upstandin ', cheap- ass whiskey- drinkin' motherfucker!
Bitch!
(blows)
Daddy, look who I found.
Well!
Enjoy your hike there, son?
Or did my mountain kick your ass?
(raucous laughter)
My butt' s seen better days, sir.
Well, why don' t you get yourself a nice massage tomorrow up at the academy?
Just don' t let that big- titted whore at the coffee house stick any needles in your ass.
I hear she almost bled some poor son of a bitch to death.
(raucous laughter)
Hi.
I' m Brandt Von Hoffman, Pine Mountain Academy team captain.
Second in command.
Casey Richards.
